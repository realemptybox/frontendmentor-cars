## Overview

### The challenge


The challenge that was given to me is to build out these card components and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned more about spacing and positioning elements, what resulted in a better understanding of margins and paddings. 


### Continued development

I am strugglin with margins, paddings. In fact, I still have a lot to learn and practise about css-grid, floats, flexbox and more.
